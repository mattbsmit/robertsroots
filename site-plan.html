        Color Palette

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a>

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page is going to be the introduction and description of what the website is going to be about. 
        It'll include mainly the logo with the option to scroll down and meet the goal and the author behind
        the site. As my grandma wrote as her purpose behind the blog that I'm going to replace, "This blog is 
        specifically for the decendants of Hugh Roberts(1) and Margaret Roberts(2)." and "Share & exchange 
        information about the Roberts family, Keep in touch with the Roberts family members. Locate and find 
        all living descendants of Hugh & Margaret Roberts, Inspire & motivate others to become involved in the 
        Roberts family research, Share knowledge, resources, and information about how to do genealogy"

      </ul>
      <h3>Articles</h3>
      <p>
        The artile page of this site is where I going to move all the articles that my grandma has on her blog
        and bring them over to this site. It consists of sharing birthdays of family members that have passed 
        away, sharing important dates for my family, and letting my family learn about our past. The hardest part 
        of this page is going to be taking all the posts from 2009 - 2022 and moving them over.

      <h3>Charts</h3>
      <p>
        This one is intresting. I don't know the purpose of why my grandma has it. It's filled with links that 
        lead to PDFs, broken links, and missing pages. From what I can tell, it's supposed to help show what type
        of documents that we use to keep track of things like birth, marriage, death, ect. Others seem to try
        and show how you fit in our family tree. It's all intresting, and something I'll have to figure out.
