                The artile page of this site is where I going to move all the articles that my grandma has on her blog
                and bring them over to this site. It consists of sharing birthdays of family members that have passed 
                away, sharing important dates for my family, and letting my family learn about our past. The hardest part 
                of this page is going to be taking all the posts from 2009 - 2022 and moving them over.
