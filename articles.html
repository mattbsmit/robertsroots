                        Ninety-nine years ago today, 136 coalminers reported for work and by 8:30 a.m. after the second trip car carried 
                        miners into the mine, there was a terrible explosion.  Residents saw an ominous plume of black smoke coming from 
                        the mine entrance.  By noon, over a thousand people gathered at the mine entrance from Kemmerer and Frontier, 
                        whose combined population was only about 2,200 people. Ninety-nine years ago today, 99 men lost their lives in 
                        the Frontier Mine No. 1 in Frontier, Wyoming.  Ninety-nine families grieved the loss of their loved ones.  The IOOF 
                        hall was lined with sheet covered deceased bodies as families came to identify their coal miners.  The Kemmerer City 
                        Cemetery and volunteers prepared three mass graves and numerous other gravesites throughout the cemetery.  
                        Dignitaries and officials arrived in the small town.  Investigations began as rescue efforts proved futile.

                        I have been busy getting everything ready for Memorial Day weekend.  I have tagged all the flowers for the Roberts family members 
                        and for the Frontier Mine No. 1 coal miners.  This is a fun tradition I look forward to every year.  I enjoy paying tribute to 
                        our ancestors and to the Frontier Mine No. 1 coal miners who died in 1923.  It is my hope that anyone visiting these graves who 
                        have not been in contact with me, will contact me. This year I decided to "permanently" tag and identify all of my heirlooms.  
                        Each tag contains a description of the item, 
                        who the item belonged to, and the line of ownership of each item.  All items will then be stored with these tags and labels.  
                        There were a couple of logistics that had to be considered.  I wondered how to label framed photographs without harming the 
                        photograph.  I decided to slip the labels into the frame on the outside of the glass.  Another problem I ran into was, how to 
                        mark a year book and smaller three ring binder.  I decided to attach "bookmarks" with labeled descriptions attached to a ribbon 
                        and added to the books--I must add these turned out very nice.    Other items, I made tags with descriptions, attached a ribbon, 
                        and tied the ribbon onto the heirloom.  I am pleased to finally have most items labeled.  All items will make a very nice 
                        display for this next weekend. I have been busy working on a couple of scrap books.  The first scrap book I had created for my 
                        father's 80th birthday, but because of time constraints, the book was put together very quickly.  This past week, I took time to 
                        identify and decorate the book so it is more attractive.  (No originals were harmed in the making of the scrap book.) The second 
                        book, was a book I started for the Roberts family many years ago. It served as a safe way to preserve a couple of oversized 
                        photographs and pages that I used when I taught or gave presentations.  I added three new beautiful pages of heirlooms and descriptions. 
                        If you have not received your invitation, contact me for the details, or look on our Facebook page.  I am excited to see everyone 
                        next weekend.
