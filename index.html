                The home page is going to be the introduction and description of what the website is going to be about. 
                It'll include mainly the logo with the option to scroll down and meet the goal and the author behind
                the site. As my grandma wrote as her purpose behind the blog that I'm going to replace, "This blog is 
                specifically for the decendants of Hugh Roberts(1) and Margaret Roberts(2)." and "Share & exchange 
                information about the Roberts family, Keep in touch with the Roberts family members. Locate and find 
                all living descendants of Hugh & Margaret Roberts, Inspire & motivate others to become involved in the 
                Roberts family research, Share knowledge, resources, and information about how to do genealogy"
              </p>
